In the realm of network security, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in safeguarding against an array of sophisticated threats. This paper introduces an innovative IDS paradigm that capitalizes on the capabilities of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to bolster the detection and classification of network intrusions.

The proposed IDS system employs supervised learning techniques, enabling it to glean insights from labelled datasets and effectively discern patterns associated with both normal and malicious network behaviour. A key strength lies in the system's adaptability, as continuous retraining ensures its responsiveness to emerging threats, thereby maintaining a proactive defence posture.

Through comprehensive evaluations against benchmark datasets, the ML-driven IDS demonstrates superior performance, characterized by heightened accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malicious activities. This research underscores the transformative potential of integrating ML into IDS frameworks, offering a more resilient and dynamic defence mechanism against the evolving threat landscape.

In conclusion, this study contributes to the ongoing evolution of IDS in network security by showcasing the effectiveness of Machine Learning techniques in enhancing detection capabilities. The findings advocate for the adoption of ML-driven IDS as a proactive and adaptive approach to fortify networks against an ever-expanding array of cyber threats.

Objective:
The objective of the project is to find or extract patterns in a network traffic dataset that are indicative enough to make users understand that they are malicious traffic. 
A traffic is said to be malicious if it consists of some data that are considered to be affecting the resources of a computer or a system. If the resources of the system get affected then the system will not able to function properly. The aim of this project is to develop an Intrusion Detection System that would consider both the internet and intranet traffic and try to monitor, track, and detect malicious data in the traffic.
